# DTR: Define the Relationship

Use this template when conducting DTR with your project partners. *It's recommended that you copy/paste this template into your own gist each time you conduct a DTR to take notes on the conversation.* 

### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

* What are each of our learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?
- Bill: Learning goals to get good with testing, better as sad paths. Reinforce skills on dom manipulation.  
- Alex: Figure out many sad paths are needed. Write the test first, then write functionality. Not wanting to fail is what is driving me. 
* What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
- Bill: Paired programming, driver/navigator. Having someone to rubber duck, and their, 
- Alex: Prefer to pair, but also open to divide and conquer on minor bug fixes and/or changes that don't require two brains. 
* How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
- Bill: Stay positive, not afraid of direct feedback. 
- Alex: Same ideas, doesn't need to sugar coat feedback. 
- We both agree not to be a dick. 
* How would you describe your work style?
- Bill: Collaboration is key. Not a late night coder. 
- Alex: Keeping communication open. 
* What are each of our strengths?
- Bill: Intuitive conceptual, identify patterns, good at research. 
- Alex: Objective oriented, break things down into managable chunks. 
* What’s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
- Bill: Git workflow has been good, PR templates. 
- Alex: Never had a bad group experience, consider groupmates friends. Keep communication often. 
* How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?
- Open communication, push things up that have a consensus on what's right. 
* How will we overcome obstacles?
- Sheer grit and determination. 
* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
- Bill: Coffee, healthy work enviornment. 
- Alex: Limit distractions, occasionally take breaks just to mentally refresh. 
* What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
- Bill: Meeting with Alison 2:30 on Wednesday, Meeting with pebble Monday @ 5:00. Eat dinner around 6 or 7, maybe some mornings depending on where we are at. 
- Alex: Late start or early finish on weekends to catch up with life things. 
* What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
- Github Project board, tuple, slack for calls. 
* How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
- Don't struggle in silence for too long, post things in the slack. 
* How do you know if a project is successful? 
- Having additional time to refactor and polish stuff, instead of rushing out a product. 

### Remote Work Considerations During the COVID-19 Quarantine
* When working from the same place where you live, life can get in the way. What are some potential life things that could interfere with your ability to focus, and what plan can we come up with to approach those issues? (Examples: my kids, my dog, my partner, etc.) 
- Bill: Sassy husky
- Alex: Keep on campus access focus going.  
* Pomodoro breaks are especially important for remote work and doubly so for quarantine. What should our Pom cadence look like? How will hold ourselves accountable?
- Try to take a pom every hour or so. Don't go for 2 hours straight and try to force solutions. 
* Quarantine is tough, so it’s important to make note of our mental/emotional state when working with others. How can we make space to check in on each other’s well being, in addition to the work that needs to be done?
- Start off conversations not talking about the project or code. Get a feel for each other and work around that.
