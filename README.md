# FitLit

The FitLit project is a paired project for Front End Module 2 students at the Turing School of Software and Design. The idea behind the project was to build an application that held users data based on a users exercise data over the course several months. The main goals of this project were to structure code progression based around Test Driven Design, implement a class based structure, and have functions and methods utilize a Singular Responsibility Principal.
